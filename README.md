Obi-Wan3's Assorted Utility Cogs for Red v3

Please see below for a list of my cogs and their statuses. 
A big thank you to the [Red DiscordBot community](https://discord.gg/red) for all the help with coding! 
Also thanks to those that have commissioned cogs through bounties (denoted below with "BC" for bounty commissioner).
